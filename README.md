Perfect, let’s stitch everything we discussed — repo name **Silicon Converge**, tagline **Verge of Silicon** — into a polished, Markdown-ready `README.md` you can drop straight into your repo.

# 🧪 Silicon Converge  
*"On the Verge of Silicon — from RTL to GDS."*  

Welcome to **Silicon Converge** — a repository documenting the installation and usage of essential open-source EDA tools for digital design, simulation, and ASIC workflows.  

This repo is your companion on the journey from **RTL to GDSII**, showing how to install, configure, and run flows with tools like **Yosys, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, ngspice, Magic, and OpenLANE**.

## ⚡ Installation  

This guide is **distro-agnostic** (tested on Arch), but the same steps apply to most Linux environments.  

### 🔹 Yosys  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
make config-gcc
make
sudo make install
````

### 🔹 Icarus Verilog

```bash
sudo pacman -S iverilog   # Arch Linux
```

### 🔹 GTKWave

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtkwave
```

### 🔹 ngspice

```bash
tar -zxvf ngspice-37.tar.gz
cd ngspice-37
mkdir release && cd release
../configure --with-x --with-readline=yes --disable-debug
make
sudo make install
```

### 🔹 Magic

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic
cd magic
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 🔹 OpenLANE

Make sure you have **Docker** and **Python 3** set up. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane
cd OpenLane
make
make test
```

## 🎯 What’s Next?

* ✅ Install and validate each tool
* ✅ Run simple RTL + simulation flows
* 🚀 Push through the full OpenLANE RTL-to-GDS pipeline
